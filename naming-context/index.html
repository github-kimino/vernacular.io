      <h1>Naming Without Context</h1>
      <p>
        One of the great things about trees is that they provide natural context for content. And
        when people edit content inside a tree, they are aware of that context. That is the reason
        why an author will know that in SVG a <code>title</code> element inside a
        <code>circle</code> element will be the title for that circle, and not for the entire
        document.
      </p>
      <p>
        Failing to use context in naming elements or attributes entails a loss in language fluidity.
        Some vocabularies that have strong roots in SGML have an excuse for this approach since DTDs
        named elements globally. This is visible in DocBook for instance: it feels daft to call
        every item in a list a <code>listitem</code> since it appears as the child of one of
        DocBook’s many list elements, but that was necessary in those days from before broadcast
        radio and widespread tap water.
      </p>
      <p>
        More recent languages have no such excuse. For instance SVG has a long list of elements
        beginning with "fe": <code>feDistantLight</code>, <code>feSpotLight</code>,
        <code>feColorMatrix</code>, <code>feConvolveMatrix</code>, <code>feGaussianBlur</code>,
        <code>feTurbulence</code>... That "fe" is meant to signify "filter effect". But the fact is
        that these elements can only appear as children of the <code>filter</code> element — they
        are always going to be in a filter effect defining context. The prefix just makes them more
        clumsy, as if all SVG elements began with "svg".
