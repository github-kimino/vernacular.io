      <h1>Unreadable Names</h1>
      <p>
        Languages will vary in how directly humans need to be involved in their creation. Some will
        be mostly handcrafted with love in a text editor while others will be mostly dished out by
        the dozen by unfeeling export scripts or will typically see the user shielded from the
        markup behind an authoring interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where you expect to fall on this spectrum will guide your decisions in terms of how much
        care to put into making your vernacular easy to author with no specific tooling. But even if
        you are in the business of documenting procedural regulations for the coming Robot Hive
        Apocalypse (in which case, “All Hail the Queen!”) you should consider the humans involved in
        the system beyond your typical user. Some people will have to look at the source in order to
        debug issues. Others will have to understand the source format in order to implement support
        for it. In general, even when humans are not expected to directly produce or consume your
        format, the more readable it is the higher quality software will accompany it — because it
        will be simpler to code to.
      </p>

        There are two primary ways in which one can make names hard to read (be it for elements,
        attributes, class names, properties — it doesn’t matter what language bit it is you’re
        naming).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is to make them too short when they are not common elements. It is a good idea
        for instance to use <code>p</code> for paragraphs as it is an extremely common element,
        but it is more dubious to use <code>s</code>. Is that going to be for strike-through or
        sup text? Was it superseded content? Should it have been kept for <code>span</code>?
      </p>
      <p>
        The other is compound names. Those can be difficult to read for native speakers of the
        language from which the names come from (typically, English) even though one has a natural
        feel for word boundaries; they often become hell for people who do not know the language
        well. The most common offender in this category is DocBook (I believe largely for historical
        reasons, and then for consistency). To wit: <code>personblurb</code>,
        <code>personname</code>, <code>audioobject</code>, <code>imageobjectco</code>,
        <code>inlinemediaobject</code>, <code>qandadiv</code>, <code>classsynopsisinfo</code>,
        <code>citebiblioid</code>, <code>simplemsgentry</code>… the <code>itemizedlist</code> goes
        on.
