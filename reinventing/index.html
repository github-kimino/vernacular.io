      <h1>Reinventing the Wheel</h1>
      <p>
        HTML comes with quite a fair bit built-in. If you add the rest of the platform that exists
        around it, you have a <em>lot</em> at your fingertips. If you’re using RDFa/Microdata, the
        same can be said of large common vocabularies like
        <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At times, though, you might feel that what’s built-in does not match your needs exactly
        enough and that you’d be better off building your own variant. There are cases in which
        that is true — otherwise we would never need new elements — but this urge should be
        resisted long and hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is easy to forget that HTML’s constructs tend to carry a lot more than what you have
        immediately in mind when you use them. In fact, that’s why you’re building a vernacular in
        the first place. To boot, they have built-in semantics. This means that they work with
        search engines, not to mention that they are accessible. Your reinvention of <code>h1</code>
        or of <code>button</code> will have none of that. They are also properly internationalised:
        have you taken the time to think about how your feature works in other languages?
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be that <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a> fails to convey some distinction
        that is crucial to you. That is both fine and expected. In that case, simply extend it by
        defining your own missing property rather than trying to replace all of the parts that you
        could actually use. The shared understanding that many other consumers of your data have
        of a well-known vocabulary will often prove far more useful than a gain in concision. There
        really is no point in being more precise if no one understands the precision at hand.
