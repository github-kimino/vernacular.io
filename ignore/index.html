      <p>
        In most domain-specific data formats, the default expectation is that a processor will
        process the entirety of the content and understand how to meaningfully operate on all of
        it. For HTML vernaculars, this expectation is less useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are defining a vernacular that concerns itself with ancillary parts of a document,
        that much should be obvious. For instance, a vernacular describing how to capture EXIF
        metadata inside of a <code>figure</code> element would not be all that useful if it forbade
        all manners of content outside of that given <code>figure</code>. You expect it to be
        embedded.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this consideration holds even for vernaculars intended to capture the primary
        content of a given page. For example, the
        <a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/">Scholarly HTML</a> vernacular intends to describe
        the entirety of a scientific article, which will typically be most of the content in a
        given page. Nevertheless, it clearly states that it concerns itself solely with the content
        of the first <code>article</code> element found in the document, and deliberately ignores
        the rest. This allows people to produce content that can be usefully interpreted as
        Scholarly HTML while fully retaining the ability to surround that content with all manners
        of other markup such as navigation, header and footer, and whatever markup needs to be
        wrapped around the article for stylistic purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to making vernaculars more useful (since they give authors a lot of leeway in
        organising their HTML around their content) it also makes them composable. There is no
        reason to stick to using just the one vernacular. For instance, one could easily use
        Scholarly HTML together with
        <a href="https://github.com/substack/html-version-spec">html-version-spec</a>.
