      <h1>Human-Readable Text in Attributes</h1>
      <p>
        It is often tempting to place text intended for humans inside an attribute, perhaps so
        as to "attach" it more directly to the element, or to make authoring terser. The
        archetypical example of this being:
      </p>
      <pre>&lt;img ... alt="photo of a dahut in the fog"></pre>
      <p>
        The issue here is that this approach breaks down as soon as one starts
        requiring structure inside the string. If you include a picture of a <code>section</code>
        element, you won’t be able to mark the <code>alt</code> up with the proper <code>code</code>
        element.
      </p>
      <p>
        That might seem like an acceptable limitation, but it gets worse: if the text is expected to
        be potentially in any language, there will be cases in which it will require structure. For
        instance, some Chinese or Japanese text requires ruby annotations (basically text that is
        rendered next to the primary text to indicate the pronunciation). Similarly, it can be
        useful to specify the writing direction when mixing languages that go in different
        directions (e.g. Arabic and French). Also, due to limitations in Unicode, some characters
        will not render correctly (i.e. will be rendered with the wrong glyphs) unless you specify
        which language the text is in — that is notably the case of the CJK set in which Unicode
        gave some Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text the same code-point even though they are
        depicted differently in each language (a rather scandalous decision, but one we have to live
        with). For this case one could place a <code>lang</code> attribute on the element to get the
        right effect on the text inside the attribute, but that would set the language of the entire
        element, not just of the title text. It’s an extreme case, but if one had an
        <code>img</code> element pointing to an image of a wine label from France, with an
        <code>alt</code> attribute in Korean, and set the <code>lang</code> to <code>kr</code> so
        that the <code>alt</code> renders right, then the language of the label would be said to be
        Korean too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the technicalities involved in getting I18N right, and given the greater extensibility
        of the element approach, it should be inferred that text intended for human consumption
        should only occur in element content. That being said, the original argument — terseness —
        has some merit for authors. In the case in which it is desired, it is therefore possible to
        define a two-tiered approach in which text can occur in either an attribute or a child
        (with the child taking precedence). But that will complicate processing code; apply with
        caution.
