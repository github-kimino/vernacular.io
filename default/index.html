      <h1>Default Values</h1>
      <p>
        Default values are commonly considered when creating APIs but too often forgotten when
        designing declarative formats, making them harder to use than necessary. Additionally,
        an important distinction often prevails in markup: whereas a method receiving an invalid
        argument will commonly produce an error, in markup it is often preferable to treat it as if
        it had been unspecified. This can lead to better decoupling between document and processor
        versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not specifying how to default values will hurt error processing (and its cousin versioning),
        and lead to interoperability issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine for instance that an author specifies the colour of an item to be <code>#99</code>
        instead of the intended <code>#999</code> because of a typo. The processor can interpret
        that in several ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Decide it’s too big an error, and melt the motherboard.</li>
        <li>Realise it’s wrong, and pick a default colour of its choosing (often black, but could be
            fuchsia).</li>
        <li>Pad with the last character, making it <code>#999</code>, with 0 (<code>#990</code>), or
            with something else that seemed to make sense while the implementer was rushing to
            finish so that she could go have a beer with the rest of her team.</li>
        <li>Throw it away, and apply a colour inherited from the same attribute higher in the tree.
            </li>
        <li>Throw it away, and consider it null (transparent).</li>
        <li>Take the inherited colour, and only change the red and green components.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most of the above will produce different colours. And since they’ll produce different
        results in different implementations, there will be no interoperability. Which solution
        works best depends a lot on the usage scenario for the vernacular, you have to make your own
        mind up there. Note however that unless you are certain that there is a user at the helm to
        handle the error or you are encoding critical information such as steps in robotic surgery,
        it is unlikely that halting and catching fire is the best option.
