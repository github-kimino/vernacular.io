      <h2>What is Vernacular HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is one of the most widespread and interoperable data formats available. It is extremely
        versatile and flexible, and everyone has a way of seeing. Combined with JavaScript, CSS,
        SVG, and the rest of the Web platform, it can be used as a very powerful format for pretty
        much everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are highly desirable properties for domain-specific data formats, but out of the box
        they come at a cost. The domain‘s applications will want to consume data that is somewhat
        more predictable than fully general HTML, and to do so interoperably.

        <dfn id='vernacular-html'>Vernacular HTML</dfn> is the practice of building domain-specific
        languages on top of HTML, fully compatible with it, for the purpose of addressing the needs
        of a specific domain in an interoperable manner. It is not a technology so much as a body of
        good practices.
