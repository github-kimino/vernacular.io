      <h2>What is Vernacular HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is one of the most widespread and interoperable data formats available. It is extremely
        versatile and flexible, and if you have access to a computer, you have a access to a browser
        with which to run it. Combined with JavaScript, CSS, SVG, and the rest of the Web platform,
        it can be used as a very powerful format for all aspects of digital publishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This generality comes at a cost, however. When your goal is the interchange of specialised
        information within a given domain, the full generality of HTML can get in the way. Your
        applications should not have to sift through some vague information soup in order to extract
        the data that they require, and equally they need an obvious way of encoding their data in
        such a way that other applications will reliably understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is the traditional purview of domain-specific data formats. These are often relatively
        simple (at least compared to the fullness of HTML) data formats, typically encoded in XML or
        JSON, with predictable rules that (one hopes) enable the interoperable interchange of
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Domain-specific data formats are, however, not a panacea. They require conversion to an
        output format (usually HTML, sometimes PDF) in order to be consumed, which is often a lossy
        operation. This can make it harder to users to interact with them; it also means that
        round-tripping them to and from user-friendly formats is an error-prone process. Not being
        directly published on the Web, their content tends to be less discoverable.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<dfn id='vernacular-html'>Vernacular HTML</dfn>” is the growing practice of creating
        domain-specific data formats using the HTML platform. Its goal is to enable interoperable,
        specialised data interchange while retaining as much of HTML's full power as is sensible
        for the given domain. It is not a technology so much as a body of good practices.
