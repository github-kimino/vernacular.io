      <h2>What is Vernacular HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        HTML is one of the most widespread and interoperable data formats available. It is extremely
        versatile and flexible, and if you have access to a computer, you have a access to a browser
        with which to run it. Combined with JavaScript, CSS, SVG, and the rest of the Web platform,
        it can be used as a very powerful format for all aspects of digital publishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        This generality comes at a cost, however. When your goal is the interchange of specialised
        information within a given domain, the full generality of HTML can get in the way. Your
        applications should not have to sift through some vague information soup in order to extract
        the data that they require, and equally they need an obvious way of encoding their data in
        such a way that other applications will reliably understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is the traditional purview of domain-specific data formats. These are often relatively
        simple (at least compared to the fullness of HTML) data formats, typically encoded in XML or
        JSON, with predictable rules that (one hopes) enable the interoperable interchange of
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Domain-specific data formats are, however, not a panacea. They require conversion to an
        output format (usually HTML, sometimes PDF) in order to be consumed, which is often a lossy
        operation. This can make it harder to users to interact with them; it also means that
        round-tripping them to and from user-friendly formats is an error-prone process. Not being
        directly published on the Web, their content tends to be less discoverable.
      </p>
      <p>
        “<dfn id="vernacular-html">Vernacular HTML</dfn>” is the growing practice of creating
        domain-specific data formats using the HTML platform. Its goal is to enable interoperable,
        specialised data interchange while retaining as much of HTML’s full power as is sensible
        for the given domain. It is not a technology so much as an incipient body of good practices.

    <section id="why">
      <h2>Why bother talking about Vernacular HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        Bodies of good practices are suspicious things. Why not <em>do and advocate through
        example</em> rather than talk about doing? In some cases, though, it is worth sitting down and
        writing up a few tips and tricks acquired through experience that might not be immediately
        obvious from just looking at what others are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML already has several extensibility mechanisms, ranging from well-known ones such as
        <code>class</code> and <code>data-*</code> to less obvious parts like <code>rel</code>. It
        also has (sadly, several) ways of overlaying additional semantics atop its markup:
        <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/microdata.html#microdata">Microdata</a>,
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer/">RDFa</a>, and <a
        href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a>. Its elements and attributes can at times
        have non-obvious meanings, a fact made worse by the occasionally cryptic language in which
        they are described in the specification. Additionally, HTML’s processing rules make it
        possible to mint your own elements and attributes and expect a reliable DOM to come out at
        the other end. With all of these options it is no surprise that people could find creating
        their own vernacular daunting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The HTML specification does contain some notes about how to use this or that extensibility
        feature, but it is worth noting that standard authors can at times suffer from
        self-important notions of right and wrong. Not that their advice should be ignored
        wholesale, but it needs to be appraised through the sieve of your detailed knowledge of the
        specific problem you are solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our approach here is of a decidedly pragmatic bent. We simply wish to exchange good ideas
        and good examples; never-ending debates about the significance of semantic meaning are very
        much out of scope.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="how">
      <h2>How do I build a Vernacular?</h2>
      <p>
        Much of the time, if you sit down and start typing out examples, you will quickly get a good
        feel for the kind of markup you want for your specific use case. Modulo some syntactical
        variation, the overall shape of it is likely to be obvious. What may not be so obvious are
        the bits that can trip you farther down the line. As a result, many of the practices listed
        here are actually <em>bad practices</em>, thing you should <em>probably not</em> be doing.
        I say “probably” because the philosophy at play here is that, ultimately, you know what
        you’re doing (if not, no amount of advice will save you). You should have no qualms about
        ignoring a red flag found here; all we’re saying is that it is likely a good idea to think
        about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The guidelines below commonly make use of examples drawn from XML vocabularies. That is
        because the problems one is likely to encounter in the creation XML and HTML languages have
        a fair amount of overlap, and the XML examples tend to be more outrageously wrong. Don’t let
        that lead you to thinking that using HTML makes you safe from such mistakes — if the problem
        is listed here, someone smart has hit that problem before.

      <h2>Where can I find some Vernacular HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        Vernacular HTML is a practice that existed long before it was given a name — as well it
        should be! Here is a short list of some examples (with varying qualities of documentation).
        If you wish to expand it, please simply

        <dd>
          AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) is a project that defines a subset of HTML (with a number
          of extensions) that enables increased performance in HTML delivery by getting rid of many
          of the causes of slowness.
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/07/pubrules?uimode=filter&amp;uri=">W3C Publication
            Rules (“pubrules”)</a></dt>
        <dd>
          Web standards are relatively formal affairs, and as such have their own formalised HTML
          vernacular in which they are expressed. It is a fairly old vernacular (created circa 1997)
          which, in terms of best practices, can sometimes show. It has nevertheless become
          instantly recognisable in the Web technology world, and certainly benefits from great
          simplicity (as can be seen in its
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/TR/W3C-WD.css">style sheet</a>).

        <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/respec/">ReSpec</a> and

        <dd>
          Since W3C “pubrules” markup can prove repetitive and at times hard to get right, many
          tools have been developed to assist people in producing it — these are the two main ones.
          ReSpec documents are essentially valid HTML with some extra configuration that a JS
          library turns into the real thing; Bikeshed is a Python preprocessor that can apply to
          HTML but is more often used in Markdown mode (and therefore not completely a candidate for
          this list).

        <dd>
          The AngularJS project sports a wealth of addition to HTML (which can take the form of new
          elements, new attributes, <code>data-ng-*</code> attributes, and a few other options) to
          add interactivity to HTML.
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/">Scholarly HTML</a></dt>
        <dd>
          Scholarly HTML is a set of constraints on HTML meant to enable the interchange of
          scientific articles. (Disclaimer: it is done by the same people who are doing this.)
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="https://github.com/substack/html-version-spec">html-version-spec</a></dt>
        <dd>
          The purpose of html-version, from the ineffable
          <a href="http://substack.net/">substack</a>, is “to make the Web more distributed,
          permanent, and robust against outages, censorship, and orphaned content”. It does so
          through specific application of <code>link</code> and <code>meta</code> values.
